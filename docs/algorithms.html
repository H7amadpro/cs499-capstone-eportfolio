  <div class="section narrative">

    <h2>Artifact Description</h2>
    <p>The artifact for the enhancement is the iOS Inventory Management Application, which was previously enhanced for software design and engineering in CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming. The original version of the application had a limited amount of algorithmic complexity, using only basic linear searches to locate items and having no sorting capabilities beyond the default order of items in the database. Additionally, there were no sophisticated data validation algorithms.</p>
    <p>The original implementation had limited performance because it simply iterated through the arrays in order to locate items. Therefore, this implementation of the application would have worked well for small data sets, but as the inventory increased in size, the performance of this implementation would have significantly decreased. The lack of regard for algorithmic complexity or optimization also contributed to this low performance.</p>

    <h2>Justification for Inclusion</h2>
    <p>I chose this artifact for my Algorithms and Data Structures enhancement since it provided an excellent opportunity to show my ability to apply algorithmic thinking to efficiently solve real-world problems. Since inventory management systems manage potentially large datasets while displaying responsive UIs, algorithmic efficiency is a critical factor.</p>
    <p>The various points in the application that demonstrate my skill in the application of algorithmic thinking include:</p>

    <div class="info-box">
      <h4>Real-Time Search Algorithm</h4>
      <p>The search algorithm implemented in the inventory application is an efficient algorithm that allows users to filter the inventory items as they enter search terms. The algorithm performs case-insensitive string comparisons on the name, SKU, barcode, description, and tags of the inventory across multiple fields at the same time with debouncing implemented to minimize the number of filtering operations performed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
      <h4>Multi-Criteria Sorting</h4>
      <p>The inventory application has a flexible sorting architecture that allows users to sort the inventory by multiple criteria including name, quantity, price, date added, and categories. The implementation of the sorting algorithm is via the Swift <code>sorted(by:)</code> method using custom comparators, achieving an O(n log n) time complexity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
      <h4>Data Validation Algorithms</h4>
      <p>I created a comprehensive set of validation algorithms in the <code>ValidationService</code> class that ensure the integrity of the inventory data prior to being stored in a permanent storage location. These validation algorithms check for required fields in the inventory data, string length constraints, numeric range constraints, format constraints, and duplicate values by using the hashtable for lookups.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
      <h4>Binary Search of Sorted Items</h4>
      <p>The <code>AlgorithmUtilities</code> class implements the binary search for looking up items in sorted data sets. The binary search has an O(log n) lookup time vs. the O(n) linear search, making it a much more efficient algorithm to use to look up items in large sorted lists.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
      <h4>Optimized Data Structures</h4>
      <p>The data model of the application has been designed using the most appropriate data structure. For ordered collections of items, arrays are used; for collections of tags requiring uniqueness (O(1) lookups); and for the mapping of items to categories, dictionaries are used to enable O(1) lookups.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Reflection on the Enhancement Process</h2>
    <p>The enhancement of the algorithmic portions of the application has given me a deeper understanding of how the concepts of theoretical computer science can be brought to the real world through performance improvements. Through the enhancement process, I was required to analyze the time and space complexity of the various approaches to the problem of enhancing the application, and through this, make the necessary decisions regarding trade-offs.</p>

    <h3>Challenges Encountered</h3>
    <p>One of the primary challenges I faced was balancing algorithmic efficiency with code readability. While I could have spent more time creating more complex algorithms with minimal performance gains, I was ultimately more focused on creating code that would be maintainable. Additionally, I faced a challenge in implementing efficient algorithms with the reactive nature of SwiftUI. In order to do so, I needed to carefully manage the use of computed properties and <code>@Published</code> properties.</p>

    <h3>Incorporation of Feedback</h3>
    <p>After receiving feedback during the code review process, I implemented memoization for some of the calculations that were called multiple times, and I implemented lazy loading for the large sets of inventory items such that only a portion of the inventory items would be retrieved from memory at any single point in time.</p>

    <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Course Outcome 3:</strong> Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to the computing solution while managing the trade-offs with respect to design choices.</li>
      <li><strong>Course Outcome 4:</strong> Demonstrate the ability to implement well-founded and innovative computing techniques and skills/tools to create computer solutions that will provide value and achieve objectives specific to an industry.</li>
      <li><strong>Course Outcome 1:</strong> Use strategies to create collaborative environments. The <code>AlgorithmUtilities</code> class is a reusable utility that has appropriate documentation regarding its purpose, inputs, outputs, and complexity so as to clearly communicate the utility's intent to a future user.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>The Algorithms and Data Structures enhancement has improved the application from a simple CRUD utility to a performance-based solution for building and maintaining an enterprise-level inventory management system through the innovation and implementation of optimized search, sort, and validation algorithms.</p>
