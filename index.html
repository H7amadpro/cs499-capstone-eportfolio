    <h2 class="section-title">Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Completing my coursework through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University and creating this ePortfolio has been an experience that has changed me as a software developer and formed my professional identity. My capstone project, which focuses on improving an iOS Inventory Management Application, is the result of multiple years of study and implementations of the foundational principles of computer science I have learned. I have demonstrated my technical strengths as well as indicated my professional values, and goals for my career in a rapidly changing field, Technology.</p>

    <h2>Shaping My Goals and Values</h2>
    <p>I have determined a clear career path during the time I studied the Computer Science program. I am choosing to specialize in mobile application development by creating secure, user-centered applications that address world problems. My coursework included a wide range of programming concepts from the basic level through advanced topics such as secure coding, database management, and Software Engineering, providing me the ability to approach a multitude of situations in the Technology industry.</p>
    <p>I have also developed my professional values throughout my time in this program. I have a high regard for creating clean and maintainable code so that other developers can read and build upon my code. Security is very important to me and has become a core part of my development approach when I start any development project by evaluating the potential vulnerabilities during the design phase.</p>

    <h2>Working Within a Team Environment</h2>
    <p>Collaboration is critically important within the modern software development environment. I have learned how to collaborate with others through my Agile experience developed in CS 250: Software Development Lifecycle. Agile has taught me how to communicate my individual progress, identify blockages in my progress, and have the flexibility necessary to be able to change my work process to align with the evolving product requirements.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I have gained knowledge of various version control systems (such as Git), how to write meaningful commit messages, create feature branches, and how to execute code reviews — all of which will aid in my ongoing success as a software developer. The in-code documentation and design patterns (MVVM) I utilized within my capstone project provide examples of how I have practiced these collaborative processes in detail.</p>

    <h2>Communicating with Stakeholders</h2>
    <p>It is important for the software developer in today's working world to effectively communicate with the various stakeholders (technical team members, business users) throughout their project. I have enhanced my communication skills through multiple assignments (technical writing, presentations, and documentation) requiring me to communicate to many different audiences.</p>
    <p>An example of an effective communication tool is the code review video I created for my Capstone project. This video demonstrates the effectiveness in communicating my technical approach to my peers and managers via annotations, showing them where I have considered the current functionality and explaining my plans for enhancing the existing product. Additionally, the narratives provided with each of the artifacts included in my ePortfolio collectively illustrate my ability to effectively communicate my decisions to technical and non-technical audiences.</p>

    <h2>Data Structures and Algorithms</h2>
    <p>A developer's ability to efficiently write scalable code relies on their foundational knowledge of data structures and algorithms. I learned about many different data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, hash tables, and graphs) and the different types of algorithms to manipulate these data structures in CS 260: Data Structures and Algorithms.</p>
    <p>I applied these principles when adding algorithms within my capstone project in the iOS Inventory Management Application to enhance the application's functionality and performance. There are several ways I used algorithms to improve my application, such as incorporating algorithms to conduct string matching when implementing real-time search/filtering features for managing the inventory items and provide the user with the ability to sort by categories such as name, quantity, price, and added date by implementing comparison-based sorting algorithms. Additionally, I included data validation algorithms in the inventory management system to ensure that the input data was accurate and maintained integrity (duplicates excluded, data types validated, and business rules enforced). My understanding of how to evaluate an algorithmic complexity will allow me to evaluate trade-offs regarding the time and space efficiency of my applications when writing code.</p>

    <h2>Software Engineering and Design</h2>
    <p>Software Engineering is the practice of not only writing code, but designing software systems that provide maintainability, scalability, and user-centered design. The courses and class assignments completed in CS 320: Software Testing, Automation &amp; Quality Assurance and IT 315: Object Oriented Analysis and Design provided a systematic approach to software development.</p>
    <p>I applied the principles of the MVVM architectural model when designing my iOS Inventory Management Application. The above text is a summary of a professional software development portfolio, presenting evidence of the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the journey in computer science. The author describes how he/she applied object-oriented design principles to build an application that can be tested by using an integrated testing process.</p>

    <h2>Database Management</h2>
    <p>Databases are critical to supporting modern applications by providing the necessary means to store and manage data. My training in Database Administration and Advanced Programming has given me an excellent foundation for working with both relational and non-relational database systems.</p>
    <p>The database for my inventory management application contains many connected entities — Items, Categories, Users, Branches, Suppliers, Audit Logs, and Item Images. Data integrity is ensured via complete support for CRUD operations with appropriate transaction control. The application provides capabilities for multiple-location inventory management, for tracking item transfers between locations, and for maintaining audit logs. My implementation of a backup and restore capability reflects my understanding of best practices for managing data.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Security is a fundamental requirement that is taken into account throughout the software development process. CS 405: Secure Coding has taught me how to be proactive when developing software. I anticipate that security vulnerabilities will exist and therefore, I take steps to mitigate them.</p>
    <p>In my inventory management application, multiple levels of security are in place. The application uses password hashing to authenticate users via password without storing passwords in plain text. There are different levels of access for users based on role (Admin, Manager, Staff, Viewer). There is support for biometric authentication via Face ID and Touch ID to enhance both security and user convenience. There is input validation throughout the application to protect against injection attacks, and all sensitive data is encrypted when stored. Finally, an extensive auditing capability ensures that all significant actions will be properly tracked and will provide the basis for supporting accountability and forensic analysis.</p>

    <h2>Summary: How Everything Fits Together</h2>
    <p>The artifacts in my ePortfolio represent my breadth and depth of skills as a computer science professional. Collectively, the iOS Inventory Management Application serves as an all-inclusive artifact of my enhancements to the three core categories of software development:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Software Design/Engineering</strong> — The application utilizes the MVVM software architectural pattern, is organized into modules, has complete error handling, and is designed and built according to best practices for developing iOS applications.</li>
      <li><strong>Algorithms/Data Structures</strong> — The revised application supports complex search and filter algorithms, efficient sorting algorithms, all of the necessary data validation logic, and optimized data structures to represent the relationships between inventory items.</li>
      <li><strong>Database</strong> — The use of SwiftData documents my knowledge of advanced database concepts including entity relationships, CRUD operations, transaction management, auditing, and backup/restore.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each of these enhancements adds up to create an integrated story of my professional development and technical knowledge. The code review video included in this ePortfolio demonstrates my analytical approach to software development, communication skills, and the corresponding narratives document my reflective and continuous-learning mentality.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This ePortfolio is representative of the professional skills and knowledge I have developed as a result of my experience. The Computer Science curriculum at SNHU has taught me the fundamentals of programming, software engineering, database management, and security, as well as the "soft" skills of communication, collaboration, problem-solving, and adaptability, that will set me apart from just another person writing code.</p>
    <p>As I am preparing to either enter the workforce or to advance in my current career, I am confident that the skills and knowledge represented in my ePortfolio will enable me to make meaningful contributions as soon as I start. I am dedicated to lifelong learning and professional development, as I recognize that the field of computer science will always present new challenges and opportunities for creative and innovative practices.</p>
    <p>I encourage you to review the content of my ePortfolio to gain a better understanding of my accomplishments and capabilities. Thank you for reviewing my portfolio.</p>
